# Low-Surface-Brightness-Galaxy
Catalog of Low Surface Brightness Galaxy, the comple catalog includes 37,536 LSB galaxy candidates.

Flag:  indicates source of the coordinates. '1' indicates that the R.A. and Dec. coordinates were provided by SDSS, while '0' indicates that the R.A. and Dec. coordinates were predicted by the GalCenterNet model.
Confidence score: The confidence score assigned by the GalCenterNet. It provides a measure of how reliable the model believes its predictions are. The confidence score vary between 0 and 1, where a higher value indicates a higher confidence level in the prediction.
Anomaly score: The anomaly score provided by Deep-SVDD anomaly detection model. A higher anomaly score indicates that the LSB galaxy is considered more deviating from the norm.
